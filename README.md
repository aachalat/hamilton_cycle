# hamilton_cycle
fast hamilton cycle tester

The original code from master's thesis work.

The work was based on a multipath implementation from Groups and Graphs. http://www.combinatorialmath.ca/G&G/

Future goals:
 - remove all linear sized data structures (with respect to graph size)
 - create a python c extension module to access core algorithms
