Tool for finding Hamiltonian Cycles in a graph.

These programs use code derived from William Kocay's
Groups and Graphs program and thesis work done by
Andrew Chalaturnyk.

Building:
---------

In the main source folder (with the Makefile) either type
'make debug' or 'make release'.  The release version will be
much faster.

Three example programs will be built from the 'example*.c' files.
These are compiled and linked to the 'hc', 'hc_count' and 'hc_list_cycle'
executables.

Execute each without arguments or with the -h flag for help on each.

Input Files:
------------

A sample input file of graphs are included in (TestGraphs.txt).

The text format for a graph is as follows: (starts after the ----)

----
$
&Graph
Petersen
10
-1 10 7 3
-2 9 4 3
-3 5
-4 7 6
-5 8 6
-6 10
-7 8
-8 9
-9 10  0
-------

The single '$' at the start of a line indicates a new graph is to be defined.
In this way multiple graphs can be defined per file.

Immediately following the '$' line the header '&Graph' must be found as in the
example.

The next line is the title of the graph being defined.

After the title line, the next line lists the number of vertices found in the
graph.  The next entries are all numerical and are separated by whitespace.

Adjacency statements for a vertex start with a negative value for the
vertex in question followed by positive values indicating which vertices are
adjacent to said vertex.  In the above example of the petersen graph 
vertex 1 is said to be adjacent to vertices 10, 7 and 3.  Adjacency
statements for an edge only have to be listed once per pair (eg vertex 10 is
still adjacent to vertices 1, 6 and 9 in the above example).

Once all adjacency statements are listed a single '0' value marks the end
of the graph definition.

Enjoy!
